-- | Generic abstract type for the decision taken by a `Connections` term:
-- a connection is either rejected or accepted, with a value of a
-- `Provenance`-indexed type. Particular `Connections` will specialize
-- these to domain-specific types.

-- | Useful type with kind `Provenance -> Type` to express that rejection is
-- not possible.
data CannotReject (provenance :: Provenance)

-- | Description of a resource: something that can be acquired in the bracket
-- pattern, or something that already exists but can be closed.
--
-- This is indexed by `Provenance` because incoming and outgoing resources
-- have different contracts: incoming ones already exist but can be closed;
-- outgoing ones _may_ be created but may also already exist.
data Resource provenance m r where
  -- | An existing resource, with a close action.
  -- Corresponds to remotely-initiated, incoming connections.
  Existing ::   r -> m ()        -> Resource Remote m r
  -- | A new resource, with create and close actions (a bracket).
  -- Corresponds to locally-initiated, outgoing connections.
  New      :: m r -> (r -> m ()) -> Resource Local m r

-- | Connections identified by `id`, carried by `socket`, supported by `m`.
-- "socket" is intended to be suggestive but obviously does not have to be a
-- socket.
--
-- For `Existing` resources, if the decision is `Rejected`, or if the call
-- throws an exception (`m` is IO-capable), then the caller is responsible for
-- closing the resource. Otherwise, the `Connections` term must ensure it is
-- closed appropriately.
--
-- For `New` resources, the caller does not create the resource, so the
-- `Connections` term is responsible for creating and closing it appropriately.
--
-- Note on exceptions: in case `m` can throw exceptions, there's some
-- ambiguity about when it's a good idea to do so, because it's not clear
-- whether an exception should be caught and used to give a `Rejected` value,
-- or simply ignore/re-thrown.
-- If the resource acquisition of a `New` connection throws an exception, that
-- should be re-thrown. This is consistent with bracketing of the acquire and
-- release fields of the `New` constructor, which also re-throws the exception.
--
-- TODO may need a way to check / be notified when there is an incoming
-- connection at a given identifier.
-- Could just put that on the concurrent connections: an `STM (Map id handle)`.
-- When you get the handle back, the underlying connection and its handler
-- thread may of course have died, but that's always a possibility even if
-- you `include`. 
--
-- TODO may be useful to bring `request` to the end and make this a
-- contravariant functor.
