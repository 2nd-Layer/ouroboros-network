The intention is apparently to use the `IOSim` thing and `runSimTrace` to get a lazy list of trace events, and analyze those. That's to say: define the big hairy mess of concurrency and side-effects up-front, and _then_ try to figure out what's going on by looking at a trace. As opposed to: define the big hairy mess in terms of simple, side-effect- and concurrency-free pieces, and find out what's going on by analyzing these relatively simple pure functional components. /rant"
